## Why another language learning?

All language learning platform feed user by thier own data, that may cover lots of unknown but it definetly is not working in user context.

- How many times did you face a new word while you are reading?

### 😿 story

Ofcourse you can search for the meaning, and save the word into your short term memory (and keep it for 6 sec), but we all know process of transfering a word from your mind-langauage to daily speek is not this easy.

### Moose will be your 🚀

Here is were we think we have a new idea 👍🏻

Nowadyas every one knows that a words must be memorized in a context.
**parabellum** means a thousnad time more when you saw [John Wick 3 - Parabellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick:_Chapter_3_%E2%80%93_Parabellum)

> Note: parabellum means `prepare for war`

So should I watch movie for every word?

> really 😐

Our Jobs is to bind and connect context for you.

Wait a second 🤠, this is what all other apps do too, so what's the point?

> This is the secrete sauce which you must know in our meetings.
